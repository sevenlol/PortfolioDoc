This is the design document for my [personal websites](https://sevenloldev.com) (will be referred to as the website in this document). I built the website because I enjoy programming and want a place to store side projects I make. The website is built from scratch with [Angular](https://angular.io) and [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io), deployed with [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com). [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) is used as the CI/CD platform for testing, building and deploying the website and its documents.
