The most important two are Angular and Firebase. I have experience with AngularJS previously, so Angular is an easy choice. As of Firebase, it is an awesome platform for web/mobile application (and its free quota is very generous). The rest of the stack is chosen around these two.

1. [Angular](https://angular.io): primary web framework.
2. [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io): UI framework.
3. [AngularFire2](https://github.com/angular/angularfire2): Angular library for Firebase.
4. [flex-layout](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout): UI layout for Angular.
5. [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/2.4/introduction.html), [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html) and Protractor: Unit tests and End to End (e2e) tests.
6. [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com): Firestore as the main database, Hosting, Function and Storage.
7. [Typedoc](http://typedoc.org/): Typescript document generator.
8. [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io): Design documents (this document).
9. [CircleCI](https://circleci.com): CI/CD platform.
